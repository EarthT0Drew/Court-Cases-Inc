                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellsberg game sensitive documents from the government to the
                New York Times, but the government obtained a court order to prevent the
                publishing of them. Therefore, Ellsberg released them to Washington Post, and the government tried
                to do the
                same thing, but the court refused. After the government appealed the case, the Supreme court ruled,
                6-3, that the prior restraint as unconstitutional.

            <h3>Backstory</h3>
            <p class="info">Ellsberg gave these papers, later known as the Pentagon Papers, to the New York Times
                newspaper company. The government gave a court order preventing NYT from publishing these papers because
                publishing these papers would "endanger national security" (FindLaw). Ellsberg in turn gave these papers
                to the Washington Post, also a newspaper company, and the governemnt
                attempted to get another court order. However, this court order was not passed, and the Government
                appealed the case to the Supreme Court.

            <h3>The Decision</h3>
            <p class="info">
                After hearing what both sides had to say, the Superme Court rulled, 6-3, that it was unconstitutional
                for the government to prevent the publication of documents, even if those documents are sensitive.

            <h3>Aftermath</h3>
            <p class="info">
                This case was taken as a victory for the Press, but not everybody agreed with the the Supreme Court
                desision, beliveing that the government should censor information in order to protect the country.
                Anyway, now the government is not allowed to prevent the publishing of documents even if they endanger
                the national security.
